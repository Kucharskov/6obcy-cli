# 6obcy analyze

## Legal aspect
To avoid legal problems (in Poland this is chapter XXXIII of the Penal Code) I contacted the service administration. In response, I obtained permission, which stated "You may experiment in this way, as long as the results do not adversely affect the safety and privacy of our users or otherwise harm our users or us".
Additionally, there was a sentence saying "We recommend not to publish such programs/scripts". Therefore, all this analysis will be made public only then when the system will work differently.

## Analyze
In the HTML code I noticed that the number of logged in users was always 1000, even though it was refreshed live on the page. It directed me to the JavaScript code and for the search of the right request. When I found ``scriptBoxEio.js`` file, which was the only non-standard file besides default external libraries, I decided to analyze it.

The whole code was obfuscated, but it's nothing unusual. At the beginning of the file there was a large table containing 2341 elements. Unfortunately, content like ``lyqvxg``, ``vckligh``, ``ufmxgrlm`` didn't tell me much. Looking at the elements in the console, I noticed that they have more readable values. Deeper in the code I found the declared function ``_sz8x_dec`` and its calling on the array elements. I did a simple test, after calling the function on the value ``123abc`` and I got ``123zyx``. This led me to the Atbash - a monoalphabetic substitution cipher with reversed alphabet letters order. Thus, the above mentioned values turned into ``object``, ``exports``, ``function``, which meant that it is an array for mapping elements in the code.

I had to find decoders that can analyze over five thousand lines of semi-readable code. Finally I used [rumkin.com Atbash decoder](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/atbash.php), [JavaScript remapper](http://output.jsbin.com/hazevo/1) and lastly [JavaScript Beautifier](https://beautifier.io/), which made the code much easier to analyze. In this way I found the address and range of ports to the final endpoint and information about the engine.io used for communication. Unfortunately, the whole client code has been encapsulated so all I have to do is to run the developer console in Chrome and start the traffic analysis.

## Packets structure, leading number, examples
Each package has a leading number. These numbers are in accordance with the [engine.io protcol](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-protocol) documentation which i found on the web. The documentation found describes the required "heartbeat" mechanism, which maintains the client-server connection. It consists of sending at equal intervals a message with code ``2`` to which the server responds with a message with code ``3``.

After a lot of conversations to generate traffic and hours of analysis of the generated traffic I managed to describe most of the packets.
### Server side packets
Initialize connection (always first packet)
```
0{"sid":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX","upgrades":[],"pingInterval":25000,"pingTimeout":40000}
```

Pong response
```
3
```

Connection accept (most second packet) - contains a hash used to sign a packet
```
4{"ev_name":"cn_acc","ev_data":{"conn_id":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX","hash":"127#0#0#1"}}
```

New chat proposal - ckey is used in almost all client packets
```
4{"ev_name":"talk_s","ev_data":{"cid":000000000,"ckey":"0:000000000_XXXXXXXXXXXXX","flaged":false}}
```

Received message
```
4{"ev_name":"rmsg","ev_data":{"post_id":0,"cid":000000000,"msg":"message_content_here"}}
```

Stranger disconnect conversation
```
4{"ev_name":"sdis","ev_data":000000000}
```

Stranger is typing
```
4{"ev_name":"styp","ev_data":true}
4{"ev_name":"styp","ev_data":false}
```

Received random topic from server-side magic
```
4{"ev_name":"rtopic","ev_data":{"post_id":0,"cid":000000000,"topic":"topic_content_here","who": 0}}
```

Advertisement
```
4{"ev_name":"r_svmsg","ev_data":"Zapro≈õ znajomych na 6obcy, kliknij [...]"}
```

### Client side packets
Ping request
```
2
```

Client init parameters
```
4{"ev_name":"_cinfo","ev_data":{"cvdate":"2017-08-01","mobile":false,"cver":"v2.5","adf":"ajaxPHP","hash":"127#0#0#1","testdata":{"ckey":0,"recevsent":false}}}
```

Conversation request - "loc" have a predefined values coressponding to voivodeships (Silesian is 7)
```
4{"ev_name":"_sas","ev_data":{"channel":"main","myself":{"sex":0,"loc":0},"preferences":{"sex":0,"loc":0}},"ceid":0}
```

Accept of new chat
```
4{"ev_name":"_begacked","ev_data":{"ckey":"0:000000000_XXXXXXXXXXXXX"},"ceid":0}
```

Client disconnection
```
4{"ev_name":"_distalk","ev_data":{"ckey":"0:000000000_XXXXXXXXXXXXX"},"ceid":0}
```

Typing information
```
4{"ev_name":"_mtyp","ev_data":{"ckey":"0:000000000_XXXXXXXXXXXXX","val":true}}
4{"ev_name":"_mtyp","ev_data":{"ckey":"0:000000000_XXXXXXXXXXXXX","val":false}}
```

Send message
```
4{"ev_name":"_pmsg","ev_data":{"ckey":"0:000000000_XXXXXXXXXXXXX","msg":"message_content_here","idn":1},"ceid":0}
```

Report stranger
```
4{"ev_name":"_reptalk","ev_data":{"ckey":"0:000000000_XXXXXXXXXXXXX"},"ceid":0}
```

Random topic request
```
4{"ev_name":"_randtopic","ev_data":{"ckey":"0:000000000_XXXXXXXXXXXXX"},"ceid":0}
```

I really dont know (but in implementation I send it too as original client sends)
```
4{"ev_name":"_owack"}
```

## Summary
The whole mechanism was realized in JavaScript with additional jQuery libraries. Most likely, in order to make the analysis of the code difficult, it was obfuscated and additionally partially encrypted with Atbash cipher.
The whole communication started with a query to the URL "ajax/addressData", which returned the appropriate address and port of the server to establish connection. This connection is established using the websocket protocol, where the data was sent in a JSON-like format.
In order for the connection not to be interrupted, packets with a specific value to sustain the connection were required ("heartbeat" mechanism). The configuration values of this mechanism, such as the interval and time to send a message, were sent in the first packet received from the server after the connection was established.
